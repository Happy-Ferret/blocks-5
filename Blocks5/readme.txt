Where is the Help?
==================
The actual game help is in the game itself.
In the main menu, you'll find a "Help" button. You can also access
the help from the in-game menu. Probably, you won't need the help
if you just play the game, because you learn all important things
from the hints that can be found in many levels.
However, if you want to make your own levels, having a look at the
help is probably a good idea.


Changelog
=========
1.1.1 ... - The default key for screenshots is now F11.

          - Added default secondary keys for some actions.

          - Added a "Donate" button in the main menu.

1.1.0 ... - The game now stores levels and user content in the
            user's "My Documents" directory. Therefore, the game can
            be run without administrator privileges.

          - In-game videos can now be recorded with the F12 key.
            Press it again to stop recording. The videos are recorded
            to the new "videos" directory. You find it inside the
            new directory mentioned above.
            Important: first choose the correct recording source in the
            Windows sound settings as the default recording source
            (should be named "Stereo Mix" or "What you hear").

          - Keys for mute, screenshot and video recording can now be
            configured in the options dialog.

          - Improved drawing performances of lasers and light barriers.
            Due to some strange ATI driver bug, this could get very slow
            before.

          - Added a "Quit" button to the in-game menu and the editor
            menu for better usability.

          - Improved the GUI behavior for better usability.
            For example, dragging scrollbars is now easier because
            the cursor is now allowed to leave the scrollbar while
            dragging.

          - Added numpad keys as default secondary keys for movement.

          - Fixed a bug where the game would crash when one character
            dies and another one is standing on a hint object.

          - Fixed a bug with screenshots not working on some machines.

          - Changed the naming of screenshots to include the current
            date and time.

          - General performance optimizations.

          - Re-colored the title screen.

          - Changed installer to ask for automatic updates.

          - Changed installer to ask before installing
            Visual C++ runtime and OpenAL.

            the player easier.

            or be displayed incorrectly.
