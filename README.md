Blocks 5 - Bob's Amazing Adventures
===================================

Build Instructions
------------------
Open `Blocks5.sln` with Visual Studio 2013 (or later) and build all projects. Then, in the `Blocks5` directory, run `zip_data.bat` and `zip_skins.bat`. The game can then be started from within Visual Studio. In order to create a redistributable version of the game, run `stage.bat`. This will deploy the complete game in `Blocks5/stage`.
